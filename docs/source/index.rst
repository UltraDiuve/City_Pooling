   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

========================================
Welcome to City Pooling's documentation!
========================================

A brief introduction
====================

This github Pages is intended to *publish* the current state of my City Pooling
personnal project.
The whole source code is hosted on github, and can be browsed here:
`The repository <https://github.com/UltraDiuve/City_Pooling/>`_

This project is my very first attempt to build a complete standalone work 
on a full development environment.

Tools used so far to build it are:

* Python 3 and some of its main libraries (matplotlib, numpy, ...)
* Anaconda to manage all the packages that orbit around Python
* Obviously, git and github to manage and host source code
* Sphinx to create this documentation, hosted on github pages
