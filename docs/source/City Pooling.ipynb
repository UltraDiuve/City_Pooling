    "### Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem has been submitted by one of my colleagues. Besides being both a nice guy and a talented developper, he also is the president of the roller federation. He therefore has to sometimes participate in the construction of french roller hockey tournaments.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is where he sometimes is faced with quite a challenge: dividing dozens of teams from various cities into smaller groups, which will then compete in round-robin tournaments. The problem is that he must try to be as efficient as possible when it comes to the cost of travel for each team. The cost of a scenario may be something as simple as the sum of total distance traveled by the teams, but it can also get far more complicated when trying to add some fairness to it: \n",
    "- trying to minimze the distance run by the team with the greatest one\n",
    "- adding other criteria to the cost function: adding the standard deviation of total distance for each team to the overall cost\n",
    "- putting some weight over the \"richest\" teams by considering the cost of distance being smaller for them...\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest case would be minimizing total distance run by all teams, and after analysis: given points on a plane, how do I split them in same size groups so that total distance between points in the same group is minimized? \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why does this problem seem interesting to me?\n",
    "Besides the immediate reward of being helpful to a colleague, the more I gave thought to this problem, the more I noticed that it presents many nice aspects:\n",
    "- being kind of \"trading salesman\"-ish, it looks like it would be an endless playground for optimization\n",
    "- furthermore, many python functionalities and libraries might get involved: iterators and generators, decorators, graphical tools from matplotlib and seaborn, file writing and reading to get some persistence, calls to Google Maps API to work on real life data... \n",
    "- last but not least, when I first got to see some solutions on problem small enough to be *brutally* solved, I noticed that I could have had them simplified (sometimes solved!) just by looking at it. I might in the end get some Machine Learning algorithms working on this subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disclaimer\n",
    "I am definitely not a professional developper (yet?), and my sometimes cumbersome logic or alien syntax might make seasoned readers cringe. I definitely am open to any suggestion as to improve the following."
