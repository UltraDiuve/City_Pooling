City_Pooling
==============
A personal project to optimize city pooling during sports competitions

So far, this project is a Jupyter Notebook and some packages:

- geography
- solver

The notebook is intended to review the "published" works whereas the main classes will be defined in the packages/modules.
The notebook is the "main" file of this project.

The whole project description is available at my GitHub pages:
